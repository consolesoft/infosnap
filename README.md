This package provides the core functionality for the `InfoSnap` CLI tool. It includes a helper function `showHelp()` that displays a styled help menu with all available commands for managing and interacting with data scraping sessions.

## 📦 Overview

The `core` package is designed to offer a built-in command-line help system for users of the `InfoSnap` tool. This tool allows you to start, view, manage, and delete scraping sessions, making it easy to extract and interact with structured web data using the browser extension.

## ✨ Features

- List of supported CLI commands
- Descriptions for all major actions: starting, stopping, exporting, and viewing sessions

## 🛠️ Usage

import "yourmodule/core"

func main() {
    if arg == "--help" {
        core.ShowHelp()
    }
}
